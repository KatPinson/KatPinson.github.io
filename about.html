<h2><i>About</i></h2>
<img src="/Final-Project/images/Katpic1.jpg">
<p>Some branches of the fiber art genre are dying slowly. Several crafts are listed as endangered by the HCA, and I wanted to create a community that could connect artists. I believe that communication is key in preventing the extinction of many different kinds of fiber arts. My name is Kat and I made this website to alleviate some of those symptoms by putting artists in contact with one another. That is why I created this website: to create a place for crafters and artists to gather, to keep art forms alive.</p>

<br>

<p>This website ended up being more of a prototype, as I cannot code everything that I want to fully within the parameters of this class. I don't know other coding languages that I would need to facilitate this or know where I can find a place to store all the files I would receive from users. But I coded the HMTL and CSS end of this project to the best of my ability.</p>
